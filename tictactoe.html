            <h1 style="font-size: 4rem; margin-bottom: 100px;">My experience making The Hangman Game</h1>
            <h3>
                Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                This is a project to practice my JavaScript skills. I made it with the help of my coding instructor. My instructor advised me to do it.

                 <h1>Here is the explanation to what I did on the HTML file</h1>
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <h3>
                    Firstly, I created a table, and for each row, I created a button.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Secondly, I gave each button its own unique ID.
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Lastly, I filled each button with an underscore to prevent errors in the code.
                 </h3>
                 <h1>HERE IS THE CODE BLOCK FOR WHAT I EXPLAINED ABOVE:</h1>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
            </h3>

                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <h1>Here is the explanation to what I did on the CSS file</h1>
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <h3>
                    Firstly, I collapsed the borders of my table, `td`, and `tr` elements.
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Secondly, for the table row, I set the height to 70px, the color to blue, the font size to 25px, and the background to a nice sky blue color.
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Thirdly, I centered my table by justifying its content and setting its display to flex.             
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Lastly, I set the height and width of the buttons to 15rem.

                 <h1>Here is the explanation to what I did on the Java Script</h1>
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <h3>
                    Firstly, I set the first player to 'X'.
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Secondly, I selected all the buttons by their IDs using the `getElementById` method.
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Thirdly, I added an event listener to every button and set it to check each time if someone has won the game when a button is pressed. 
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <h3>Fourthly, I created a function to change the player after a button is pressed.</h3>
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <h3>Fifthly, I created a function that checks if someone has won using a series of if-else statements.
                 </h3>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <h3>Lastly, if none of the if-else conditions match, the `else` option runs, which calls the change player function.</h3>
                 <br>
                 <br>
