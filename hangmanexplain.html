            <h1 style="font-size: 4rem; margin-bottom: 100px;">My experience making The Hangman Game</h1>
            <h3>
                Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses. Originally a paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                This is a project to practice my JavaScript skills. I made it with the help of my coding instructor. My instructor advised me to do it.

                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <h3>
                  Firstly, I created a div and named it 'base'.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Secondly, I placed the hangman image in the div.
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Thirdly, I created a table and styled it to resemble a keyboard.

                 <h1>Here is the explanation to what I did on the CSS file</h1>
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <h3>
                    Firstly, I hid the overflow-x, then I displayed a grid and centered the items.
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                    Secondly, I adjusted the image size as needed.
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                  Thirdly,I made the keyboard look more appealing by      setting its height, width, and padding/margin.
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Lastly , I set the display property of the result div to flex and fixed its height and width.

                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <h3>
                    Firstly, I created an array called wordList and added a lot of words to it.
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Secondly, I created a random word picker using Math.random().
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Thirdly, I took all the images and stored them in an images array.
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <h3>Fourthly, I gave each button its own click event listener.</h3>
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <h3>I wrote an if-else statement to check if the inputted letter matches any of the letters in the random word and replace the corresponding "_" with the letter.
                 </h3>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <h3>Lastly, I created a function to change the hangman image when the input is wrong or doesn't match any of the letters.</h3>
